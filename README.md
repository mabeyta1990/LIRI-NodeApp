I really kind of choked on this assignment. I had a hard time getting anything to work. The twitter token says it is invalid but I regenerated it a few times and it still doesn't work. Also, the spotify api 'items' doesn't seem to be defined for some reason which I got from the docs. Also, when I used let instead of var I got errors that data was undefined. ES6 problems or maybe just bad coding on my behalf. The omdb api was also very hard for me to get working. This is definitely something I really should study more to understand.
